		<h2>Mt. Tamalpais</h2>
		<p>Located in Northern California, just North of San Francisco, lies one of the most beautiful mountains in all of California. Hiking trails are scattered throughout rolling hills, with views of the Pacific in all directions.</p>
		<p>On a clear day, visitors can see the Farallon Islands 25 miles out to sea, the Marin County hills, San Francisco and the bay, hills and cities of the East Bay, and Mount Diablo. On rare occasions, the Sierra Nevada's snow-covered mountains can be seen 150 miles away.

		<p>You won't want to miss a sunset from the top of Mt. Tamalpais ridge. On a warm night, the fog builds up and looks like waves along the horizon. Truly a surreal sight to see.</p>
